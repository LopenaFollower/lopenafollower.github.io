			<h2>Blog Post #1: Portfolio Building</h2>
			<p>On the first few meetings in class, our teacher presented to us a few questions to assess our prior knowledge, understanding, and expectations of the subject of MIL. Here are my answers to the following questions:</p><hr>
			<h3>1. What was your perception of media before this lesson? What is your view of media now?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I see media as a place or platform where people can share information and interact with one another. It was not obvious to me that media was categorized into traditional and new media and simply thought they were the same.</li>
				<li>After this lesson, I am now able to disect the different parts of media and distinguish their functions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2. What is the most relevant function of media to you? Why?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Among the many functions of media, I would personally say that communicating to others and the ability to watch news would be the most relevant.</li>
				<li>These are relevant because they serve as an important factor to our day to day living.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>3. Can you recall a recent situation wherein media and information literacy could have been useful?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As I usually use media for entertainment, a situation wherein media is useful was whenever there is information to be conveyed or received, an example for this would be school announcements communicated either in the diary or in the class group chat.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Blog Post #2: Media Timeline</h2>
			<p>For the second blog, we were tasked to create a timeline that highlights the different stages of media and how it has evolved over time.</p>
			<p>Media, as we know it today, has come a long way, dating back to prehistoric times, when its simplest form was through cave paintings using symbols. It has eventually developed to what we have now with the help of technological breakthroughs. Presented below are the significant stages of media and their breakthroughs.</p>
			<hr>
			<div>
				<h2>Prehistoric Age</h2>
				<div class="responsive">
					<p class="left justify"style="padding-right:14px">One of the first essential skills that man has developed was communication. The earliest evidence, discovered in Southern France, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period (which was around 30,000 BCE) are the crude paintings and symbols found in the walls of caves.</p>
					<div class="right">

						<sup>Chauvet cave paintings, Southern France</sup>
					</div>
				</div>
				<b>Other evidence for communication</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Use of natural materials such as tree bark, bones, and sticks.</li>
					<li>Mesopotamian clay tablets, Hammurabi's Code (around 1772 BCE).</li>
					<li>Papyrus and other writing tools by the Egyptians.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h3>Early Printing Technology</h3>
				<div class="responsive">
					<p class="left justify"style="padding-right:14px">Around 200 CE, in East Asia, the Chinese utilized woodblocks and engrave text by pressing ink into the surface of the wood.<br><br>Movable types, invented in the year 1040, have replace the woodblock system.<br><br>In 1453, with Johann Gutenberg's contributions, movable types were improved using his skills in metals.<br><br>These printing technology paved the way to more efficient and improved systems.</p>
					<div class="right">
						<img style="width:100%"src="https://kids.kiddle.co/images/9/98/JikjiType.gif"></img>
						<sup>Chinese movable types</sup>

					<tr><td style="font-weight:900;font-size:1.5em;margin-top:.83em;margin-bottom:.83em;">Industrial Age</td></tr>
					<tr><td><p>As civilizations and technology have advanced further, mass printing of early pamphlets and newspapers were possible with Gutenberg's printing press.</p></td></tr>
				</table>
				<ul>
					<li>In Western Europe, around the late 1590s, the first newspaper was printed.</li>
					<li>The technology soon reached america around the 1690s.</li>
					<li>Magazines soon followed, with the first ones appearing around 1741.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Other technologies invented</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Photography: Invented by Louis Daguerre in 1839.</li>
					<li>George Eastman‚Äôs Kodak made cameras easy-to-use and more accessible. (1888)</li>
					<li>Telegraph: Invented by Samuel Morse in 1844, allowing distant coded messaging.</li>
					<li>Telephone: Invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, giving the ability to talk over long distances.</li>
					<li>Phonograph: By Thomas Edison (1877), which was later refined by Emile Berliner‚Äôs gramophone (1887).</li>
					<li>Radio: With the experiments of James Clerk Maxwell on electromagnetic waves (radio waves), Heinrich Hertz's demonstration on transmitting radio waves, and other contributions by √âdouard Branly and Oliver Lodge, Guglielmo Marconi was able to commercialize the radio system. It was later used as a one-way form for sending information, birthing the term "broadcasting."</li>

				<li>For film, there were tape formats like the VHS and disc formats like the laser discs, VCDs, and now DVDs.</li>
			</ul>
